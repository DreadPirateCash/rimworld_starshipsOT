This is an expansion mod for SRTS Expanded that adds in the iconic starfighters from Star Wars original trilogy.

These generally consist of single man, small cargo capacity ships so their practicality is mainly limited to role-playing or decoration, although they can be used as transport and will have combat capability.
To offset this they have been designed to be easier to research and cheaper to build so you can make fleets instead.

Current ships included are:

- Imperial Lambda Shuttle
- TIE Fighters
- TIE Interceptors
- TIE Bombers
- TIE Defenders
- Darth Vader's Custom TIE Advanced
- Slave 1
- X-Wings
- A-Wings
- Y-Wings
- B-Wings
- Millenium Falcon

A second expansion with even more ships is in the works including Clone Wars era Jedi starfighters, Clone LAAT Transports, Razor Crest, Ebon Hawk, U-Wings, Ghost, Kylo's Custom TIE, and Maul's Custom TIE.
Anything ships larger than that such as rebel transports or star destroyers I feel is probably too big to be *realistic* and will most likely never be included.
